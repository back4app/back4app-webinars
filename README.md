Canvas Pong
===========

This is a small experiment to implement a version of the classic Pong game in an HTML <canvas>.

 * You can find the [game here](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/14/javascript_pong/demo.html)
 * You can find out [how it works](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/14/javascript_pong/index.html)

You can also play this game in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omimkinlomnncbmnceacpkmlbfaapojj?hl=en-US)


NOTES
=====

 * No support for mobile devices (need to handle touch events instead of key input)
